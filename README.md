# Maze
By Benjamin Catalfo, Steven Holmquist, Samuel Catalfo, and Gabriel Catalfo<br />

Ideas to Implement:<br />
Different types of tiles (door tile, key tile to open door, wall tile, floor tile, metal (indestructible) door, portal tiles that take you to its corresponding tile)<br />
Let the user make and share their own maps using serialization<br />
Items (we can have a c4 item that can blow open a door even without a key, but you only have a limited amount of charges)<br />
Soundtrack (Steven and Gabe!)<br />
Minigames (for example you might have to play a minigame to open a certain door tile)<br />
